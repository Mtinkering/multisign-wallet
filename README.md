# multisign-wallet
- Simple web app with governance on spending(transfers). A certain number of approvals is needed
- App is deployed on https://sad-newton-c03e49.netlify.app/
- Switch your metamask to Kovan Test network
- Code is heavily inspired from my tutor from the course: https://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/p/6-figure-blockchain-developer

# Demo:
- Create the wallet and seed with some tokens and some ether
- Set quorum to be 2
- Approver 1 approves the transaction
- Approver 2 approves the transaction

  => Now transaction should be proceeded.

- Transactions should be proceeded the moment the second approver approves it.
